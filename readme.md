# Script for scraping TSB statements and saving it into a csv file

Unfortunately, the TSB online-banking kinda sucks, you can't download more than 150 items at a time :/, so I wrote a script to download all my statements and dump them in a csv file.

To run this:

1. Download all these files into a folder
2. Run `npm install` or `yarn`
3. Run `yarn start` or `npm start`
